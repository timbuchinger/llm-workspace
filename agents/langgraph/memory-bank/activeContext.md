# Active Context

## Current Focus
Initial project setup and POC development focusing on:
1. Basic end-to-end functionality
2. Core agent capabilities
3. Essential UI components
4. Basic authentication

## Recent Decisions
1. Selected Vue.js for frontend over alternatives
2. Chose FastAPI for backend implementation
3. Decided on JWT for simple authentication
4. Selected LangGraph for agent orchestration
5. Integrated LiteLLM for model flexibility
6. Planned LangFuse monitoring from start

## Active Considerations

### Phase 1: Basic End-to-End POC
- Set up basic FastAPI project structure
- Implement simple Vue chat interface
- Basic Chroma integration with test data
- Initial WebSocket implementation
- Basic agent with search capability

### Phase 2: Authentication & Data Persistence
- PostgreSQL schema implementation
- JWT authentication system
- User management CLI
- Conversation history storage
- Frontend login integration

### Phase 3: Vector Store Integration
- Connect to Notion vector store
- Implement memory vector store
- Enhance agent search capabilities
- Add memory management tools

### Phase 4: Multi-LLM Support
- LiteLLM integration
- Model selector implementation
- Conversation model tracking
- Basic provider configuration

### Phase 5: Monitoring & Polish
- LangFuse integration
- Error handling improvements
- Loading state management
- Basic styling implementation
- Initial documentation

## Next Actions
1. Set up project repository structure
2. Initialize FastAPI project
3. Create basic Vue application
4. Set up PostgreSQL database
5. Configure vector stores

## Open Questions
1. Specific Notion vector store structure
2. Memory vector store schema
3. Required LLM provider list
4. Monitoring metric priorities

## Recent Changes
- Defined project architecture
- Selected technology stack
- Created implementation plan
- Documented requirements
- Established priorities

## Current Status
Ready to begin implementation with:
- Clear architecture defined
- Technology choices made
- Implementation plan created
- Initial priorities set
- Development phases outlined

## Known Issues
None at this stage - beginning implementation

## Next Milestone
Phase 1 completion: Basic end-to-end POC with:
- Simple agent interaction
- Basic vector search
- Minimal UI
- Test data integration
